            <img src="testimonialimg/bob.jpg" alt="bob">
            <p>I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean. I watch the ripples change their size, but never leave the stream. It's War-hol, actually. We're lovers, and that is a fact. I care for no one else but you. So I said 'So long', and I waved 'Bye-bye'.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h5>Dan</h5>
            <img src="testimonialimg/dan.jpg" alt="dan">
            <p>Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful. It's a very modern world, but nobody's perfect. Don't kid yourself they belong to you, they're the start of a coming race. It's the terror of knowing what this world is about — watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out!".</p>

            <h5>Stu</h5>
            <img src="testimonialimg/stu.jpg" alt= "stu">
            <p>They don't dig anything. He makes you laugh, he brings you out in style. In this age of grand illusion, you walked into my life out of my dreams. I'm an alligator. Pale blinds drawn all day.</p>

            <p>I wave to the policemen, but they don't wave back. I care for no one else but you. He makes you laugh, he brings you out in style. Don't you wonder sometimes, 'bout sound and vision? He'll think about paint and he'll think about glue, what a jolly boring thing to do.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h5>Jan</h5>
            <img src="testimonialimg/jan.jpg" alt="jan">
            <p>Never look back, walk tall, act fine. Don't tell your papa or he'll get us locked up in fright! Strange games they would play then. You're such a wonderful person — but you got problems. So softly a supergod cries. Somewhere, someone's calling me when the chips are down.</p>

          <li>
            <h5>Winifred</h5>
            <img src="testimonialimg/winifred.jpg" alt="winifred">
            <p>It's a moving world, but that's no reason to shoot some of those missiles. So softly a supergod cries. I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk. I've never done bad things. Don't tell your papa or he'll get us locked up in fright! I kissed a lot of people that day.</p>
